# sbgEComAnalyzer

**sbgEComAnalyzer** is a C++ project designed to evaluate candidates' skills through a series of tasks of increasing complexity, involving the analysis of binary logs generated by SBG Systems devices.

The project is split into multiple levels of difficulty, allowing interviewers to tailor the assessment to the candidate's experience and expertise.

## 📦 Purpose

This repository serves as a technical test to assess:

- C++ development proficiency
- Ability to work with binary data
- Algorithmic thinking
- Optional: UI development using QML

---

## 🧪 Test Levels

### 🔹 Minimum Level

These tasks are required to demonstrate basic understanding and manipulation of binary log data:

- **Device information extraction**: Parse and display metadata about the device (e.g., type, firmware version).
- **Log duration**: Calculate the total duration of the log.
- **Trajectory length**: Compute the total distance covered in the log based on position data.

### 🔸 Intermediate Level

These tasks assess intermediate understanding and data structuring capabilities:

- **GeoJSON export**: Convert the parsed trajectory into a valid [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/) format.
- **Satellite statistics**: Extract and compute statistics related to GNSS satellite visibility and quality.

### 🔺 Advanced Level

These tasks evaluate the ability to handle concurrency and larger datasets:

- **Multiple logs**: Handle and analyze multiple log files in parallel, including merging or comparing results.

### ⭐ Optional

These tasks are not required but may demonstrate advanced or front-end development skills:

- **QML visualization**: Display the parsed trajectory on a map using QML (QtLocation and QtPositioning modules).

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++20 or later
- CMake ≥ 3.25
- Qt (for optional QML visualization, may need to update `CMakePresets.json` to fit your Qt installation)

### Build Instructions

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlexandrePTJ/sbgEComAnalyzer.git
cd sbgEComAnalyzer
cmake --preset debug
cmake --build --preset debug
ctest --preset debug
````

## 🧠 Notes for Candidates

* You are free to use standard libraries and well-established open-source libraries.
* Write clean, maintainable, and well-documented code.
* Include comments explaining your design choices where relevant.
* Unit tests are a plus!
